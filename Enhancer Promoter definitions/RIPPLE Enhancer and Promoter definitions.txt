Enhancer - any genomic region greater than 2500 bp away from a TSS and has at least 1 non-zero feature from the dataset
Promoter - any genomic region that contains a TSS or is less than 2500 bp away from a TSS and has at least 1 non-zero feature from the dataset

only enhancer promoter pairs less than 1MB apart were consider
