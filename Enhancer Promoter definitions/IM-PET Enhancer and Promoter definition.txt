promoters - 2 kbp upstream and 0.5 kbp downstream of a transcription start site annotated in GENCODE
Enhancers - 2 kbp long predicted by CSI-ANN algorithim with a 5% FDR

enhancer promoter pair selection from ChIA-PET data criteria
(i) cis interactions with ≥ 5 PET counts  
(ii) one interacting site contains p300 site but not promoter, and the other interacting site contains promoter but not p300 site; 
(iii) promoters need to be expressed based on matching RNA-Seq data 
(IV) overlap with a predicted enhancer

MCF7 and K562 ChIA-PET data was used to generate training data
